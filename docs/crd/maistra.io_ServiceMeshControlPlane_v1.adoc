ServiceMeshControlPlane represents a deployment of the service mesh control plane. The control plane components are deployed in the namespace in which the ServiceMeshControlPlane resides. The configuration options for the components that comprise the control plane are specified in this object.

.Table ServiceMeshControlPlane Fields
|===
| Name | Description | Type

| apiVersion
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
| string

| kind
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
| string

| metadata
| 
| <<metav1_ObjectMeta>>

| spec
| The specification of the desired state of this ServiceMeshControlPlane. This includes the configuration options for all components that comprise the control plane.
| <<ControlPlaneSpec>>

| status
| The current status of this ServiceMeshControlPlane and the components that comprise the control plane. This data may be out of date by some window of time.
| <<ControlPlaneStatus>>

[#ControlPlaneSpec]
== ControlPlaneSpec

maistra.io/api/core/v1

ControlPlaneSpec represents the configuration for installing a control plane.

.Table ControlPlaneSpec Fields
|===
| Name | Description | Type

| istio
| Specifies the Istio configuration options that are passed to Helm when the Istio charts are rendered. These options are usually populated from the template specified in the spec.template field, but individual values can be overridden here. More info: https://maistra.io/docs/installation/installation-options/
| link:maistra.io_ServiceMeshControlPlane_HelmValues_v1.adoc[HelmValues]

| networkType
| DEPRECATED: No longer used anywhere. Previously used to specify the NetworkType of the cluster. Defaults to "subnet".
| link:maistra.io_ServiceMeshControlPlane_NetworkType_v1.adoc[NetworkType]

| profiles
| Profiles selects the profile to use for default values. Defaults to "default" when not set.  Takes precedence over Template.
| []string

| template
| Template selects the template to use for default values. Defaults to "default" when not set. DEPRECATED - use Profiles instead
| string

| threeScale
| Specifies the 3Scale configuration options that are passed to Helm when the 3Scale charts are rendered. These values are usually populated from the template specified in the spec.template field, but individual values can be overridden here. More info: https://maistra.io/docs/installation/installation-options/#_3scale
| link:maistra.io_ServiceMeshControlPlane_HelmValues_v1.adoc[HelmValues]

| version
| Version specifies what Maistra version of the control plane to install. When creating a new ServiceMeshControlPlane with an empty version, the admission webhook sets the version to the latest version supported by the operator. Existing ServiceMeshControlPlanes with an empty version are treated as having the version set to "v1.0"

[#ControlPlaneStatus]
== ControlPlaneStatus

maistra.io/api/core/v1

ControlPlaneStatus represents the current state of a ServiceMeshControlPlane.

.Table ControlPlaneStatus Fields
|===
| Name | Description | Type

| annotations
| Annotations is an unstructured key value map used to store additional, usually redundant status information, such as the number of components deployed by the ServiceMeshControlPlane (number is redundant because you could just as easily count the elements in the ComponentStatus array). The reason to add this redundant information is to make it available to kubectl, which does not yet allow counting objects in JSONPath expressions.
| map[string]string

| conditions
| Represents the latest available observations of the object's current state.
| []Condition

| components
| 
| []ComponentStatus

| lastAppliedConfiguration
| The full specification of the configuration options that were applied to the components of the control plane during the most recent reconciliation.
| link:maistra.io_ServiceMeshControlPlane_v1.adoc#ControlPlaneSpec[ControlPlaneSpec]

| observedGeneration
| The generation observed by the controller during the most recent reconciliation. The information in the status pertains to this particular generation of the object.
| integer

| reconciledVersion
| The last version that was reconciled.
| string
